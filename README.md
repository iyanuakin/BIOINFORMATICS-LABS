# BIOINFORMATICS-LABS
__Here are my first micro-projects on Bioinformatics.__
#My beautiful beginning.

__PURPOSE:__
- I started this repository for readmes where I store work history as I explore Bioinformatics tools like IGV, NCBI, and SAMtools amongst others.
- In the readmes you will see how I am learning to use these bioinformatics tools to manipulate *.bed, *.sam, *.bam files and lots more.

__BRIEF:__
- I worked on these in fulfilment of a course during my Masters degree. I have very minimal understanding, BUT as I practice, I'm seeing patterns, connecting the dots, and getting excited about the power of Bioinformatics.
- My class had a educational allocation of 500 GB High Performance Computing (HPC) available at /project2/msbi32400. So when you see it called in the command line, it means working with the class directory-- perhaps moving/copying files or directories
- I am able to work with Linux OS, connect remotely and securely to the HPC using the MobaXterm app.
- The app is open-source and is available for download/installation from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ 
- My computer at the time is a Windows 10/16GB/64-bit. Kindly note that PowrShell is an available alternative for Windows. 
- I wanted to experience another UI and my Professor recommended it, hence my use of MobaXterm.

__PROGRESS__
- I've learnt TO CONFIDENTLY use basic command line tools like wget, time, top, nohup, grep, echo, tree, wc and all the mighty __vim__-- a powerful Text editor that used to scare me.

__ASPIRATION__
- Do a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) Project.
