# BIOINFORMATICS-LABS
__Here are my first micro-projects on Bioinformatics.__

#My beautiful beginning.

__PURPOSE:__
- I started this repository for readmes (of my work history) as I explore Bioinformatics tools like IGV, NCBI, and SAMtools.
- In the readmes you will see how I am learning to use the aforemtnioned Bioinformatics tools to manipulate *.bed, *.sam, *.bam files and lots more.

__BRIEF:__
- I worked on these in fulfilment of a course during my Masters degree. I started with very minimal understanding, BUT as I practice, I'm connecting the dots, seeing patterns, building a foundation and getting excited about the power of Bioinformatics.
- My class had a educational allocation of 500 GB High Performance Computing (HPC) available at /project2/msbi32400. So when you see it called in the command line, it means working with the class directory-- perhaps moving/copying files or directories
- I am able to work with Linux OS, connect remotely and securely to the HPC using the MobaXterm app.
- The app is open-source and is available for download from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ 
- My computer at the time is a Windows 10/16GB/64-bit. Kindly note that PowerShell is an available alternative to MobaXterm for Windows users. 
- I wanted to experience another UI (because I use PowerShell for another project) and my Professor recommended MobaXterm, hence my use.

__PROGRESS__
- I've learnt to CONFIDENTLY use basic command line tools like `cd`, `pwd`, `wget`, `time`, `top`, `nohup`, `grep`, `echo`, `tree`, `wc`, `jobs -r` and the mighty __vim__ (it used to scare me).
- I can conveniently tar and untar files; create, copy, rename, delete and move files to and through directories; and use in-app modules etc.
- I ensure more efficient workflow with shortcuts like the tilde `~` (for home directpry), fullstop `.` (for current directory (cd)), two fullstops `..` (for the parent directory of the cd).
- I use `echo $?` to confirm that my last command ran successfully

__ASPIRATION__
- Do a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) Project.

 Thanks for stopping by! Check me out in some months for growth/progress updates.
